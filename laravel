1) Set up
Installation guide: https://laravel.com/docs/5.2#installation
Use Composer to install: 

1.1) Install composer
1.1.1) Download composer
from here: https://getcomposer.org/download/
or just run this in terminal:
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
This downloads the installer to the current directory
1.1.2) run the hash verification
You can then run hash (but get the exact command from the composer download site)
php -r "if (hash_file('SHA384', 'composer-setup.php') === 'e115a8dc7871f15d853148a7fbac7da27d6c0030b848d9b3dc09e2a0388afed865e6a3d6b3c0fad45c48e2b5fc1196ae') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
1.1.3) run the installer
php composer-setup.php
1.1.4) remove the install file
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
1.1.5) Make composer global
move the .phar file to PATH, i.e:
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

1.2) Install Laravel with composer:
1.2.1) Install laravel
composer global require "laravel/installer"
1.2.2) Make it global
add "~/.composer/vendor/bin" to your path, i.e 
vim ~/.bashrc
add this line to bottom:
export PATH=$PATH:~/.composer/vendor/bin

2) Creating a project
run "laravel new [projectname]" (or spark new, if you use spark)
Look into app/Http/routes.php file, important file for all routes
Can use anonimous functions or reference controllers. Views are usually loaded, and views are stored in "resources" directory
default: welcome.blade.php
Views can be organized in the views folder by creating new folders, and referenced with a dot "." notation or slash "/" notation.

3) Passing data 
Several options, if you have an array:
$test = ['en', 'en annen', 'en tredje'];
return view('test', compact('test')); Using compact is only one of many options.
return view('test', [
	'test' 	=> $test,
	'ditt' 	=> $ditt,
	'datt' 	=> $datt
])
